Part 2: Missionaries & Cannibals puzzle

Data structures: 
------------------------------------------
ArrayList<String> steps: stored possible steps taken to move cannibals and missionaries from one shore to the other
ArrayList<String> validSteps: stored the right sequences of scenarios with a valid solution
int missLeft: stores the number of missionaries on the left shore 
int canLeft: stores the number of cannibals on the left shore 
int missBoat: stores the number of missionaries on the boat
int canBoat:  stores the number of cannibals on the boat
int missRight: stores the number of missionaries on the right shore 
int canRight: stores the number of cannibals on the right shore
int boatLoc: stores location of the boat (0 for right, 1 for left)

Functions (located in Missionaries.java):
--------------------------------------------
*  possible(int missLeft, int canLeft, int missBoat, int canBoat, int missRight, int canRight, int boatLoc, ArrayList<String> steps, ArrayList<String> validSteps):
	returns true if current scenario is possible
	
* invalidVariables(int missLeft, int canLeft, int missBoat, int canBoat, int missRight, int canRight, int boatLoc):
	returns true if any of the variables are not possibles (i.e. more than 3 missionaries or more than 3 cannibals, limit on boat exceeded)
	
* solution(int missLeft, int canLeft, int missBoat, int canBoat, int missRight, int canRight,int boatLoc)
	 returns true for a valid scenario (i.e. boat cannot cross the river with no one on board, cannibals on either bank cannot out number the missionaries on that bank)
	 
* repeatedScenario(String scene, ArrayList<String> steps): 
	returns true current scenarion has been run trough before


Algorithm:
----------------------------------------------
starts with everyone on the left shore and pass these conditions to possible()

* if solution() is true return true
* if this scenario was done before return false
* if variables are invalid return false
* else recursively run the program until we reach the end where everyone is on the opposite shore



steps required to compile and run the program:
----------------------------------------------
Main function is in Missionaries.java
can be run from the command line using "javac Missionaries.Java",or can be run in any java IDE such as eclipe or IntelliJ
package name will need to be changed to whichever default package you create if you make a different java project
